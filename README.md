# What's this?

 This project was based in [bitcraftCoLtd/finite-state-machine](https://github.com/bitcraftCoLtd/finite-state-machine).

 I decided that there should be a simpler way and I created **nf.statemachine**, a plugin that helps you to use [statemachine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine/) in your Unity3d projects in a clear.


# The fast track
 All you have to do to start using it in your project:

* [Download this .unitypackage](https://github.com/netpyoung/nf.statemachine/raw/master/statemachine-0.0.1.unitypackage), extract its content on your Unity3D Project.


# Example
If you want to try it I've uploaded a small example that you will be able to find in the `example` folder. Download the folder and open it with Unity3d to give it a try. It contains classes that will help you to start.
